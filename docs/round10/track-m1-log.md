# Track M1 log: land animals on the shared mob registry

Branch `track-m1`, worktree `C:\Dev\mc-wt\track-m1`, target dir `D:\iw4l-wt\track-m1`. Brief: `docs/round10/track-m1.md`. Mob list: `docs/round10/mobs.md` (the `## M1` rows only). Registry: `docs/round10/track-d0.md` (D0-2, D0-3).

A commit can't name its own hash, so each entry names the commit before it. Its own hash is in `git log` under its subject.

- Added: none yet.

## Hooks

Root hooks this track added (M10, "Hooks this track adds").

- **"Registered Minecraft mobs can run their own AI step"** (rabbits-live 1): `EntityWorld::family_goal_step_with::<S, W>(id, level, players, movement_speed, ai, run)` in `entities/src/world/families.rs`, with the type `AiStep<W>` (`monster_ai_step`'s signature, returning the landed fall distance). `family_goal_step` is now that call with `monster_ai_step`.

#### 1. Registered Minecraft mobs can run their own AI step

After df7258b4.

- **Checked first:** D0's merged `family_goal_step(id, level, players, movement_speed, ai)` always calls the fixed `monster_ai_step` (`families.rs`), so no family could swap the step; the hook commit was needed.
- **Changed (vendored entities crate, root `world/families.rs`):**
  - New `pub(in crate::world) type AiStep<W>`: `fn(&mut MonsterAi, &mut Body, f32, &mut LegacyRandom, &mut Vec<(Voice, DVec3)>, &mut i32, DVec3, i32, u64, &W, &MonsterStep) -> Option<f64>`, exactly `monster_ai_step`'s arguments.
  - New `EntityWorld::family_goal_step_with::<S, W>(id, level, players, movement_speed, ai, run)`: the same core sync as before around `run` (hurt-by, body, health, eye height, tick count, griefing, daylight and the movement speed with effects in; yaw, look and hurt-by back out), and the fall damage on the distance `run` returns, through `S::hurt` with the monster or creature fall sound.
  - `family_goal_step` is now `family_goal_step_with(.., monster_ai_step)`, so silverfish, endermites and the probe run as before.
  - Both are `pub(in crate::world)` (the hook) and `pub` (the old helper): `MonsterStep` is private to `world`, so only families under `world/families/` can pass their own step, which is where every family lives.
- **Tests added:** `world::families::tests::a_registered_mob_runs_its_own_ai_step_with_its_core_in_sync` (a test step on the probe sees the core's hurt-by, position, health, max health, eye height and movement speed; the yaw, head yaw and hurt-by it sets reach the core; the eight blocks it returns hurt the probe for five with the hostile big-fall sound).
- **Decisions:** the hook takes a plain `fn` pointer of `monster_ai_step`'s signature (M10 names it so), not a closure: a family's own step reads and writes its state through the `MonsterAi` it is given (its `GoalExtra`), because the core and the state are borrowed apart around it.
- **Test steps:** nothing new to see; the old registered mobs behave as before. Release build, survival, Normal, by night in a stone cave. Name each screenshot by its label.
  1. Use the silverfish egg twice on stone 6 blocks away: they crawl to you and bite, and hitting one wakes the other. **m1-hook-1**
  2. Use the endermite egg: it crawls to you and bites; an enderman egg nearby turns the enderman on it.
- **Kit:** none new (D0's kit line has the silverfish and endermite eggs).
