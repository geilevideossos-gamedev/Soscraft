# Track C log: guns and grenades as real items

Branch `track-c`, worktree `C:\Dev\mc-wt\track-c`, target dir `D:\iw4l-wt\track-c`. Briefs: `docs/round9/track-c.md` and the design `docs/WEAPONS.md`. Base: `24dfdf71`.

A commit can't name its own hash, so each entry is written with its commit and names the commit before it; the last entry's hash is in `git log` under its subject.

## C11.1 The fork item table

### 1. Fork items have their own table: ids, kinds, stack sizes and names

Commit: the one after `24dfdf71`.

- **Changed:**
  - `minecraft_terrain` `fork_items.rs` (new, edition 2021, rustfmt-clean): one row per fork item of WEAPONS.md 7.2-7.6, 8.1, 9.1 and 10.1, 94 rows: 63 guns (riot shield and launchers included), 2 gun parts, 13 attachments, 7 ammo types, 5 lethal grenades and 4 tacticals (the tactical insertion included). Each row has the id (`iw4l:...`), the kind (gun, ammo, lethal, tactical, attachment, part), the MW2 weapon key (`iw4:weapon/m4_mp`, `t5:weapon/galil_mp`, `iw5:weapon/iw5_ksg_mp`, `iw5:weapon/xm25_mp`), the bucket (the gun class for guns, lethal or tactical for grenades, `Other` for the rest), the ammo item id, the max stack (guns 1, rockets and explosive rounds 16, else 64), the English fallback name, the tier, the icon source (MW2 kill icon, MW2 HUD icon, an MW2 material, or a vanilla sprite with a tint), the fire-proof flag (Barrett and M240) and, for attachments, the MW2 attachment names (aliases). The row order is the creative order (`creative_order()`). Functions: `rows`, `get`, `is_fork`, `by_weapon`, `by_alias`, `ammo_index`, `load` (fills a catalog through the `Catalog` trait), `add_names` (the `item.iw4l.*` keys) and `table_hash`.
  - Vendored `minecraftoss_player::item_catalog`: `ItemCatalog` derives `Default` and gains `insert`; `ItemProperties::plain(max_stack)` gives the absent-item defaults (no fuel, speed 1.0, no remainder, no armour, no durability).
  - Vendored `minecraftoss_core::item`: `ItemCatalog::insert_max_stack`.
  - `fork_items::load` runs on the player catalog in `minecraft_terrain::crafting::load_recipes` and on the core catalog right after `Registries::load` on the host (`render_anim/src/minecraft_world.rs` `load`) and on the friend (`render_anim/src/minecraft_remote.rs` `prepare`).
  - `item_icons::item_name` looks up `item.<namespace>.<path>` and `block.<namespace>.<path>`, then the table's English name; `item_icons::language` adds the `item.iw4l.*` keys (English fallback; MW2 localized names come in commit 3), also when the pack has no `en_us.json`.
  - `minecraft_survival::session::registry_fingerprint` also hashes the fork table, so a friend on a build with another table is refused.
  - Vendored `minecraftoss_entities` `world/piglins.rs`: `piglin_wants` refuses every `iw4l:` id (an additive arm right after the griefing check).
- **Tests:**
  - `minecraft_terrain` `fork_items::tests`: `every_class_picker_and_preset_weapon_has_a_row` (reads `ui/src/classes/setup.rs` `cac_roster` primary to tactical rows, 51 weapons, and every `*:weapon/*` of `frame/src/class_presets.rs` with `include_str!`, so a new class gun fails the test), `ids_and_weapons_are_unique_and_in_the_fork_namespace`, `the_roster_has_the_designed_size`, `stack_sizes_follow_the_design`, `guns_have_ammo_and_only_netherite_guns_resist_fire`, `the_creative_order_puts_guns_by_class_then_parts_attachments_ammo_and_grenades`, `names_fill_the_language_map_without_replacing_existing_keys`, `both_catalogs_take_the_fork_stack_sizes`, and, with the 26.3 data, `two_identical_guns_on_the_ground_do_not_merge` (a real `Level` with the fork-filled core catalog: two sticks merge, two M4A1s stay two, two frags merge).
  - Vendored: `minecraftoss_core` `item::tests::inserted_items_have_their_max_stack`, `minecraftoss_player` `item_catalog::tests::inserted_items_have_their_max_stack`, `minecraftoss_entities` `world::piglins::tests::piglins_never_want_fork_items` (a bare-handed piglin wants a stick and gold, never a gun, a grenade or ammo).
- **Decisions:**
  - **No zombie, allay or fox pickup exists in the fork** (searched every `items_in` caller): only piglins and villagers pick items up. A bare-handed piglin wants any item (`can_replace` with an empty hand), so the refusal arm went into `piglin_wants`. Villagers want only their food and farming items, so they never take a fork item and got no arm. The arm tests the `iw4l:` namespace because the vendored entities crate cannot see `fork_items`; every `iw4l:` id is a fork item. WEAPONS.md 4.1 updated.
  - **When `artifacts/item-catalog/26.3.json` is missing** the recipe book keeps no catalog, as before: attaching a catalog holding only the fork rows would switch off the book's built-in fuel table and the lava bucket remainder, so furnaces would stop working in that mode. In that degraded mode (already warned about: "stacks of 64") guns stack like every item in the inventory; on the ground they still never merge, because the core catalog is always filled. WEAPONS.md 4.4 updated.
  - The ground merge test lives in `minecraft_terrain`, not in the vendored world crate: the world crate has no `Level` test harness, and the terrain test exercises the real `fork_items::load` on the real core catalog.
  - Tiers follow WEAPONS.md section 3: pistols, machine pistols, SMGs, parts, early attachments and the grenades are `Early`; rifles, shotguns, the specials, rifle ammo, shells, explosive rounds, middle attachments and the tactical insertion `Middle`; snipers and sniper rounds `Diamond`; LMGs, the AT4, RPG, Strela, China Lake, XM25, LMG ammo, rockets and the thermal scope `Nether` (the thermal scope needs magma cream, so it sits with the Nether stage of section 3 although 9.1 calls it "late"); the Barrett, Stinger, Javelin and heartbeat sensor `Late`.
  - The CZ75 (T5) is a pistol and the FMG9 (IW5) a machine pistol in the bucket; both share pistol ammo as WEAPONS.md says.
  - English fallback names drop the "(T5)" and "(IW5)" of the design tables (they are annotations), so two rows are called ".44 Magnum" and two "SPAS-12". MW2's localized names replace them in commit 3 where the session has them.
  - Ammo tints (brass, copper, grey, gold, red, green) are picked RGB values in the table; the sprites themselves are read at runtime (commit 3).
- **Owner's test steps:** nothing new to see yet; fork items can be given from commit 2 on.
  1. Start the world as host: it loads as before (no new warning in the log).
  2. Two windows (`scripts\mp-local.ps1`): the friend on the same build joins as before.
- **Kit:** none needed.
