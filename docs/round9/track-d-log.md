# Track D log: finish survival

Branch `track-d`, worktree `C:\Dev\mc-wt\track-d`, target dir `D:\iw4l-wt\track-d`. Briefs: `docs/round9/track-d.md` and the mob list `docs/round9/mobs.md`.

A commit can't name its own hash, so each entry names the commit before it. Its own hash is in `git log` under its subject.

Hit keys for MW2 bullets: track D uses 29 upward, one per new mob store, recorded in `docs/round9/mobs.md`.

## Group mobs-list-drowned-load

### 1. Round 9 mob list: the 52 missing Minecraft mobs

After 24dfdf71.

- **Changed:** new `docs/round9/mobs.md`: one row per missing mob from the D2 table (where it is met, what exists, what is left, size, group key, hit-key byte, status, commits), the hit-key bytes (0-28 taken, 24 and 25 unused but left to the other tracks, track D from 29 up), the batching rule (one `EntityWorld` store per vanilla family), the six-step mob pattern with its `file:line` sites re-checked at 24dfdf71, and the shared prerequisites P1-P10 with the group that builds each.
- **Tests:** none (docs only).
- **Decisions:**
  - The brief's rows 27-30 (fish) and 35-36, 37-38 (guardians, nautiluses) are split into one row per mob, so every mob has its own status.
  - Hit-key bytes 24 and 25 are free in the code but were reserved by round 8's track B; track D keeps to 29 upward as the brief says.
- **Test steps:** none (docs only).

### 2. Minecraft drowned are saved, loaded and seen by friends

After 80caed9e.

- **Vanilla (javap, 26.3):**
  - `ConversionTracker` (the zombie's drowning tracker) converts with `ConversionParams.single(mob, true, true)`: keep the equipment, keep `CanPickUpLoot`.
  - `ConversionType.SINGLE` and `convertCommon` copy to the new mob: position and motion, riding, every equipment slot and its drop chance, fall distance, on-ground, leash, absorption, effects, baby, `CanPickUpLoot`, left-handedness, `NoAI`, persistence, custom name visibility, invulnerability, no-gravity, portal cooldown, silence, the entity tags and the custom name component. The new mob gets a new UUID and its own attributes and health.
  - `Drowned.createAttributes`: the zombie's attributes plus `step_height` 1.0; navigation `AmphibiousPathNavigation`.
- **Changed:**
  - `minecraft_terrain/src/server_mobs.rs`: `minecraft:drowned` is in `SIMULATED_KINDS`, and the zombie arm of `spawn_saved` loads it as `ZombieKind::Drowned` with step height 1. A drowned with AI loads on `spawn_drowned_pursuit` (its `DrownedAttackGoal` and target goals with amphibious navigation, the fork's only drowned AI); with `NoAI` it loads inert like any zombie. New `converted_zombie_tag`: what a converted zombie keeps of the old zombie's saved tag (equipment, drop chances, `CanPickUpLoot`, `LeftHanded`, `NoAI`, `PersistenceRequired`, `CustomName`, `CustomNameVisible`, `Invulnerable`, `NoGravity`, `PortalCooldown`, `Silent`, `Tags`, `leash`), never its UUID, attributes or drowning clocks.
  - Vendored `entities/src/world.rs`: `EntityWorld.zombie_conversions` records each `(old id, new id)` of a drowning conversion (zombie to drowned, husk to zombie), taken with the new `take_zombie_conversions`. Both conversions now also keep the armor slots (`keepEquipment`). `convert_zombie_to_drowned` is public, and a zombie on the goal framework (every zombie in the game) becomes a drowned on the drowned attack profile instead of an inert one, so a fresh drowned and a reloaded one behave the same.
  - `minecraft_terrain/src/server.rs`: after the entity tick, `carry_zombie_conversions` moves the old zombie's saved tag to the new mob through `converted_zombie_tag`, as the piglin conversions already did. `mob_tags_where` writes no equipment for zombies; it keeps what the loaded tag had, so before this a converted drowned was saved with empty hands.
  - `HATCHING_EGGS` grows to 37 with `drowned`: the drowned spawn egg hatches a drowned.
  - `mob_tracking.rs` already gives drowned the monster range of 8, and the drowned's drawn state (arms raised, baby, hand item) already goes through the zombie's `MobShow`.
- **Tests:**
  - `server_mobs::tests::a_drowned_saves_and_loads_as_a_drowned`: a loaded zombie with a damaged trident, an iron helmet, a name and a UUID converts; the conversion is reported once; the saved drowned keeps the trident with its damage, the name, a new UUID, no attributes and no drowning clock; it loads into a fresh world as a drowned with its health (11), trident, helmet, step height 1 and the attack profile.
  - `mob_tracking::tests::a_friend_sees_a_drowned`: the tracker adds a baby drowned with a trident to a watcher, and `spawn_tracked` on the added tag makes it on the friend under the host's id, a baby with its trident and step height 1. (The brief said `spawn_tracked` on `look(tag)`, but `look` strips `Pos` and is only what the tracker compares; the friend spawns from the full added tag, as every other kind does.)
  - `server::tests::a_zombie_that_drowns_keeps_its_equipment_and_name_as_a_drowned`: a summoned zombie with a trident and a name converts on the server; after `carry_zombie_conversions` the drowned's saved tag keeps both and the zombie's tag is gone.
  - `server::tests::every_spawn_egg_of_a_mob_the_game_has_hatches_that_mob` with `drowned` (37 eggs).
  - Runs: `minecraft_terrain` lib 1119 of 1120 green in the full run; the one failure, `sections::tests::background_full_update_matches_the_synchronous_one`, is a timing test of the background section updates (no mob code), and it passed twice when run alone. `minecraftoss-entities` lib 230 green (`drowned_conversion_replaces_id_and_copies_common_mob_state` among them). `check -p launcher` green.
- **Decisions:**
  - A loaded drowned runs the existing drowned attack profile (`spawn_drowned_pursuit`) rather than the zombie's goals: the zombie goals would float it to the surface and walk it like a zombie. It has no wandering, water or beach goals yet; those come with the `drowned` group (D1 commit 3).
  - The friend loads the drowned through the same `spawn_saved` and runs no AI, as for every mob.
  - A converted mob keeps the vanilla `convertCommon` fields that the fork saves in the tag; effects and absorption are not kept because the zombie's effects are not saved by `mob_tags_where` yet (they are not today either).
- **Test steps (survival):**
  1. At a river edge use a zombie spawn egg on the floor of water two blocks deep, so the zombie stands under water. Wait about 45 s: it shakes and turns into a drowned (**1_drowned_converted**).
  2. Use a drowned spawn egg on the shore: a drowned appears and the egg is used. Use another on the water floor: a second one (**2_drowned_eggs**). Stand in the water with them at night (`/time set night`) or in the water by day: they come at you and hit; block with the shield.
  3. Save and quit, then load the world again: every drowned is still there, moves and attacks; one killed drops its loot (**3_drowned_after_reload**).
  4. Friend window: the friend sees the same drowned in the same places, baby drowned small, and can hit them with the sword and with a gun (**4_drowned_friend**).

```

## State doc changes

- `docs/MINECRAFT-SURVIVAL.md`: drowned are now saved, loaded, hatched from their egg and seen by friends; a zombie that drowns keeps its equipment and name as a drowned. Drowned still have no natural spawns, no trident throw and no water or beach goals (D1 commits 2 and 3 of the brief, group `drowned`).
